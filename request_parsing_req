<HTTP/1.1>

-- HTTP/1.1 defines the sequence CR LF as the end-of-line marker for all
   protocol elements except the entity-body

-- the content-type header decides how the body lines should be ended

-- check the parsing for each header, each header field can have  values that in other headers are invalid
   search for this in the rfc:  Many HTTP/1.1 header field values consist of words separated by LWS
   or special characters. These special characters MUST be in a quoted
   string to be used within a parameter value (as defined in section
   3.6).

-- URI should be less or equal to 255 bytes of lenght else  return 414 (Request-URI Too Long) status

-- URI only supports a set of characters look it up

-- handle hex incoding "%2d" in URI 

-- content-type header values are case-insensitive, parameters are;

-- ignore leading /r/n in Request
